# School District Analysis
# Overview 
## Purpose
The school board for Thomas High School(THS) notified the district that its grade file for standardized test scores showed evidence of academic dishonesty. More specifically, the ninth grade reading and math scores appeared to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they expressed that they wanted to uphold state-testing standards. Based on this, the district asked that these grades be replaced with a "not a number" (NaN) designation for the math and reading scores while keeping the rest of the data intact. The school district analysis was repeated after the impacted scores were removed. The results are provided in the following sections of this report.
# Results
## Analysis 
The removal of Thomas High Schools 9th grade standardized test scores for math and reading had little impact on the overall findings. The math and reading scores were respectively, 79.0% and 81.9% before they were replaced. The subsequent math and reading scores were respectively, 78.9% and 81.9% which reflects a negative change of 0.1% for the math scores.  The summary report was reviewed for verification that the NaNs had successfully been applied. Thomas High School remains in the top five schools based on the overall percentage passing, math and reading scores.
