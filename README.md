# School District Analysis
# Overview 
## Purpose
Thomas Highschoolâ€™s school board notified the district that its grade file for standardized test scores showed evidence of academic dishonesty. More specifically, the ninth grade reading and math scores appeared to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they expressed that they want to uphold state-testing standards. Based on this, the district asked that these grades be removed (replaced with NaNs) for the math and reading scores while keeping the rest of the data intact. The school district analysis was repeated after the impacted scores were removed. The results are provided in the following sections of this report.
